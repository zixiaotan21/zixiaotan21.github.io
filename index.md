# 👋 Hello there!

I am a Master's student in Statistics at Duke University. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's in Mathematics at Beijing Normal University. 

- **Statistics Background**: My academic path has led me to explore Bayesian Statistics and Causual Inference,  shaping my unique understanding of mathematics theory.
- **LLM Experience**: With 5+ years of experience in AI, I've contributed as a Data Scientist Intern @ [Tencent Company](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/) and AI developer Intern at @ [Foshan Industry Group]. 
- **Personal Interests**: I write Chinese Calligraphy and read some Chinese poetry.

## 🎨 Creative Outlet

*Lines of code, strokes of art* — both speak a language beyond words. Generative art becomes my passion towards digital creativity. See my inspirations for the art pieces below: [1](https://youtu.be/WVJQ-6HbhdU?si=nMHAE69dy7xJCDQk), [2](https://youtu.be/fTa1v_MQbVY?si=B5zon-IvvS_qDcAd), [3](https://youtu.be/hbluXvy32qM?si=M2fkeMDKa0oP6obE), [4](https://youtu.be/ZMwJ6R9BE48?si=e-l-_JlKeO6fkONs), [5](https://youtu.be/E7nWMWlVHyA?si=Fr0-VwcWUu8QzZsI), [6](https://youtu.be/ibOThZNkbuw?si=oa0gPrVAGBqeeXnS).
